# Playstore-Data-Analysis
This project uses Playstore Apps and Reviews Datasets. The objective is to analyze the data and get valuable insights from it. I used Pandas and Numpy libraries of Python 
for Data Preprocessing. Then I used mySQL to extract important information. The file contains the preprocessed datasets along with the .py file and the .txt file that 
contains the mySQL queries.
